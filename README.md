# Jim's Art Cafe - Capstone Project Task 42

A potfolio website for my personal digital art built as part of the Hyperion Dev Bootcamp task 29 and 42.

## Description

The portfolio is styled in the form of a menu for a hypothetical art cafe run by Jim. There are signature dishes on square plates and a selection of puddings to choose from. Each dish clicked goes to a more modern white gallery page where the artwork can be seen (usually on a platter), saved or liked. There is a saved for later/favourites page and an about page for the artist also. The gallery pages are dynamically populated from session storage and objects. On the favourites page you can choose your favourite and comment, or send a message from the about us page.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

The pages are responsive and should work well on any modern browser or phone. Google Chrome is recommended as is desktop viewing for full appreciation.

### Installing

By clicking on the index file in thye "Jim's Art Cafe Capstone" folder the website should run automatically on a browser with GitHub hosting. Alternatively all the files in the Art Cafe folder can be downloaded and run locally in the same fashion by opening the index file in a browser such as Edge.

### Using the site

The site is a menu listing 8 sample works. Click to view them.

On each page there is a like or save button. Once saved you can view all your favourite images together on the favourites page where you can also choose your favourite and say why.
