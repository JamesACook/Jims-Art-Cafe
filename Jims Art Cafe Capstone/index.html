<!-- T42 Capstone HTML/CSS Interest Website Upgraded-->

<!-- This is an ambitious responsive web/mobile design following the digital art of "Jim". It is a 
portfolio based on a "pop-out" menu which is a play on pop art or pop up terms and the phrase "to pop out". 
Yorkshire themed with fairly traditional home image vs modern deep pages intentionally as a juxtaposition. 
See notes at bottom for reviewer like a checklist. A major revamp here was to cut down from 10 pages to 3
before adding the saved items page. We have made the gallery pages dynamic with session storage and a
JSON object storing the text/titles/img src and so on. Local storage is used for the saved items and the
basic set up for a survey/comment is on the saved for later page. We used to have an e-mail href link now
we have a contact form on the artist's abut page. We have set up the liked buttons also ready for later
further functionality to be added. We have a much improved directory structure now with images, css, script
artworks, in own folders. We have mulitple script files too carefulyl divided too avoid runtime errors
in the console.-->

<!--NOTES FOR HYPERION DEV REVIEWER
  checklist for task:
1) Save for later page - added with also an empty state and clear button. Each artwork has a save button.
2) It counts number in the saved array to alert thte total saved as require
3) Leave comments - see the saved page for a survey of favourite image and reasons
4) Like button - changes to liked with a heart which in lecture Pieter Hills said seemeed enough for now
5) Contact form - set up ready on about page.
6) BONUS - dynamic gallery pages installed via scripting and JSON objects reduces number of pages so much
easier to edit. 
7) New cleaner directory structure
8) Still a highly responsive site with even logos and so on created by CSS responsively.
9) Saved Images/favourites link on each page as suggested in lecture.

The dynamic gallery pages are significant work with session storage and took perhaps most of the time and
were not required but akin to the required tasks so hopefully plenty of demonstration here. Things like
like counters or storing messages sent and comments could be made to work artificially but would seem to 
come later for full fucntionality when have hosting/accounts/database access perhaps. I am a bit behind 
after a series of setbacks so am hoping there is more than enough here done.
